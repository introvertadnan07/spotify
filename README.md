Spotify Project

A simple web-project recreating a Spotify-style interface.

🔍 What it is

This repository contains a frontend project built with HTML and CSS, creating an interface inspired by Spotify. The core files include:

spotify.html — the main page with the layout and content

style.css — styling for layout, typography, and components

backward_icon.png — an asset used (likely navigation/back arrow)

🛠 Features

A clean UI layout similar to a music streaming app.

Responsive-style CSS (depending on design) to handle different viewports.

Navigation and controls typical of music interface (playback, back button, etc).

Uses HTML & CSS only (no backend or JavaScript logic added yet).

🎯 Why this matters

Building UI clones of popular apps is a great way to:

Practice layout techniques (flexbox, grid, positioning)

Improve CSS skills (selectors, responsive design, theming)

Develop eye for visual design (spacing, alignment, typography)

Prepare for larger frontend projects (adding interactivity later)

🚀 Getting started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/introvertadnan07/spotify.git


Navigate into the project folder.

Open spotify.html in your web browser.

View and tweak style.css to play with layout, colors, fonts, etc.

📋 What you can do next

Add JavaScript to enable real playback controls or simulation of track progress.

Integrate with an API to fetch tracks and dynamically render a playlist.

Make the design fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop).

Replace static assets with real album covers and song metadata.

Add animations (hover states, playback bar movement) for polish.
